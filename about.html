 <p>Origami has been around since the 17th century, it was invented in Japan.and by the mid-1900s, it had become a popular art form worldwide.Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”).Origami was initially known as orikata (folded shapes). In 1880, however, the craft became known as origami. Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture.Traditionally, it was believed that if one folded 1000 origami cranes, one's wish would come true. It has also become a symbol of hope and healing during challenging times.</p>

The art form has even inspired the design of things like airbags and heart stents. Since the past few years it is increasingly being used by companies and researchers in space, medicine, robotics, architecture, public safety and the military to solve vexing design problems, often to fit big things into small spaces.The ancient art of origami has inspired designs for numerous pieces of hardware on NASA missions, allowing scientists to pack more technology into smaller space-bound packages.</p></div>
